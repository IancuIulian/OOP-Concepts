Why is main static?
Answer 1:
    The main method is static in Java beause the JVM needs to call the main method without creating an object of your class.

Answer 2:
    The main method is static since it must be be accessible for an application to run before any instantiation takes place.


The static keyword can be used in 4 scenarios

    static variables
    static methods
    static blocks of code.  //these are executed before construcor
    static nested class

static variable

    It is a variable which belongs to the class and not to object(instance)
    Static variables are initialized only once , at the start of the execution . These variables will be initialized first, before the initialization of any instance variables
    A single copy to be shared by all instances of the class
    A static variable can be accessed directly by the class name and doesn’t need any object
    Syntax : Class.variable

static method

    It is a method which belongs to the class and not to the object(instance)
    A static method can access only static data. It can not access non-static data (instance variables) unless it has/creates an instance of the class.
    A static method can call only other static methods and can not call a non-static method from it unless it has/creates an instance of the class.
    A static method can be accessed directly by the class name and doesn’t need any object
    Syntax : Class.methodName()
    A static method cannot refer to this or super keywords in anyway

static class

Java also has "static nested classes",A static nested class is just one which doesn't implicitly have a reference to an instance of the outer class.

Static nested classes can have instance methods and static methods.

There's no such thing as a top-level static class in Java.
