 *
 *  Interface - a completely abstract class that contains only abstract methods
 *            - cannot contain an implementation of the methods (it is possible in Java 8)
 *            - cannot be instantiated â€” they can only be implemented by classes or extended by other interfaces
 *            - cannot contain a constructor (because interfaces cannot be instantiated)
 *            - can contain constant declarations. All constant values defined in an interface are implicitly public, static, and final
 *
 *  A class can inherit (extend) from just one superclass, but can implement multiple interfaces!
 *
 * If your class claims to implement an interface, all methods defined by that interface must appear in its source code
 * before the class will successfully compile.
