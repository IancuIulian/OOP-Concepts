Object:
- any real world thing that you want to represent in a program
- contains 2 parts: -properties (something it has)
		    		-actions (something it does)


Class:
- representation of common properties & functions of an object
- it is the type of and object
- a class is some kind of blueprint


Constructor:
- a special method that is called when you use the "new" operator (when you create an object)
- performs initializations of instance variables of a class
	

Encapsulation:
- it helps us to show/hide what user can access	(encapsulation ~ data hiding)
- setting public getter method to read the private data fields
- setting public setter method to update the private data fields


Inheritance:
- the process where one class acquires properties of another
- keyword:  " extends "
- the derived class can access base class properties AND the derived class has its own properties.


Abstraction:
- is achieved by  using interfaces or abstract classes
- an interface or abstract class is something which is not concrete, something incomplete.

		Abstract class:
		-  a class that is declared abstract
 		-  it may or may not include abstract methods
 		-  cannot be instantiated, but can be subclassed.
		
		Interface:
		- a completely abstract class that contains only abstract methods
		- cannot contain an implementation of the methods (it is possible in Java 8)


Polymorphism:
- the ability of an object to take on many forms

     Note: The superclass reference variable can point to any object of it's subclasses;
           Depending on that object, it can call the overriden method of the method it defines
 
     Polymorphism types: - Compile time polymorphism (static binding) -> method overloading
                         - Runtime polymorphism (dynamic binding) -> method overriding


Method OVERLOADING:
- same class 
- same name
- different argument list (parameters)


Method OVERRIDING:
- different class (Parent - Child)
- same name
- same argument list (parameters)
